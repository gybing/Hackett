/**
    A Linux-specific class that can embed a foreign X11 widget.

    Use this class to embed a foreign X11 widget from other toolkits such as
    GTK+ or QT.

    There are two ways to initiate the Xembed protocol. Either the client creates
    a window and passes this to the host (client initiated) or the host
    creates a window in which the client can reparent it's client widget
    (host initiated). XEmbedComponent supports both protocol types.

    This is how you embed a GTK+ widget: if you are using the client
    initiated version of the protocol, then create a new gtk widget with
    gtk_plug_new (0). Then query the window id of the plug via gtk_plug_get_id().
    Pass this id to the constructor of this class.

    If you are using the host initiated version of the protocol, then first create
    the XEmbedComponent using the default constructor. Use getHostWindowID to get
    the window id of the host, use this to construct your gtk plug via gtk_plug_new.

    A similar approach can be used to embed QT widgets via QT's QX11EmbedWidget
    class.

    Other toolkits or raw X11 widgets should follow the X11 embed protocol:
    https://specifications.freedesktop.org/xembed-spec/xembed-spec-latest.html
